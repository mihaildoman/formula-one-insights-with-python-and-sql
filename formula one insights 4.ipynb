    "Since its inception in the 1950s, Formula One has represented the pinnacle of global motorsport, pushing the boundaries of racing and automotive engineering. This analysis leverages Python and SQL to uncover insights into the achievements of drivers and constructors across F1's decades-long history.\n",

The second notebook handles data retrieval from the F1DB database. The third notebook is dedicated to creating statistics and visualizations. The fourth notebook explores the question of who is the Greatest Driver of All Time. The fifth notebook consolidates multiple CSV files into separate Excel worksheets."

    "# The Greatest Driver of All Time\n",
    "The phrase \"greatest of all time\" is often heard in the world of Formula One. However, it is challenging to definitively identify a single driver as the GOAT, given how much the sport has evolved over the years. Would someone like Hamilton or Verstappen have been as competitive in the front-engine machinery of the 1950s? Could Lauda or Senna have matched the fitness and athleticism required of today’s drivers?\n",
    "\n",
    "While Lewis Hamilton is widely regarded as the greatest Formula One driver of all time, we will conduct a thought experiment. By considering a range of factors, we will develop a rating for each of the 12 Formula One eras. This rating will then be used as a multiplier to adjust and scale the achievements of each driver. Finally, we will analyze the results to see how they compare.\n",
